in the wide, open areas of outer space,beyond the shining lights of a million stars, a dark, smoky Earth can be seen, lonely and silent.

the deepest seas are all but dried and gone.

what had once been blue sky is now brown, polluted with dust.

At times, this brown sky can still look almost golden when sunlight shines through it.

Underneath the thick, dusty air that covers the planet, mountains can still be seen rising up through the smoke.

Citis, that were once great, are now filled with old and empty buildings falling apart.

these buildings share the land with hundreds of tall towers made of rubbish.

the rubbish has perfectly shapede into cubes and arranged, one cube on top of another. these towers of rubbish can be viewed as far as the eye can see.

Only one things moves along this empty and hopeless twenty-century scene.

Day in and day out, for more than seven hundred years, he has worked to clean up the mess left by mankind.

Storms of sand and dust that often sweep along the empty streets seldom stop hin from his task.

he drives his hands, shaped like shovels, into the mountains of litter around him.

Then, he picks uo the littee and places it into the compacting unit in his chest.

Once full, he closes the doors of his compacting unit and shakes a little.

Almost immediately, he produced yet another perfect cube ready to be added to a tower of rubbish.

This is his directive.

It is what he has been programmed to do.

His name is WALL.E: Waste Allocation Load Lifter, Earth calss.

He is a robot.

He is damaged, dirty, and rusted...

And he is about to change the entire world.

"Chirrp!" A little cockroach jumped happily onto WALL.E's shoulder.

As the heavily polluted winds began to pick up speed, WALL.E and his only friend started out on a rather rough ride toward home.

WALL.E's treads were wearing thin, and the cockroach held on bravely as they crossed the rocky ground.

WALL.E drove over miles and miles of land, silent and empty life.

He saw old buildings; he passed by worn-down highways; he wheeled across the remains or broken bridges.

Everything was marked with the same company's name: BUY-N-LARGE, BnL for short. BnL had its stamp on everything!

Famous for its huge superstores, the company had once been in charge of running the entire planet.

As WALL.E hurried ahead, he ran over an old newspaper.

"TOO MUCH RUBBISH! EARTH COVERED! BNL CEO ANNOUNCES GLOABAL EMERGENCY!" read the writing on the newspaper.

WALL.E did not notice.

He pass an area full of other rusted WALL.E's units, shut down long ago.

The cockroach watched excitedly as WALL.E stopped to examinesometing of interst on one of the old units--its treads.

The treads were thick belts of rubber, built to protect the WALL.E units' metal wheels.

This old unit's treads were in much better shape than WALL.E's.

WALL.E quickly changed his old pair with the newer ones.

Then, moving on, WALL.E felt the cockroach sitting down happily on his shoulder, enjoying the new, smoother ride.

WALL.E rode past a BnL sign-board, activating its electronic picture message as he moved. The image came to life.

The lively voice of a human presenter, recorded centuries ago, began speaking through several loud speakers.

"Too much rubbish in your face? There's plenty of space out in space! BnL star liners leaving each day. We'll clean up the mess while you're away!"

WALL.E headed across an uneven highway over-pass, activating another ancient sign-board. Through the smoke and dust in the air, the image of a shining BnL star liner came into view on the screen.

Its happy passengers appeared to be enjoying all the comforts and benefits of a luxury cruise ship.

"The best of the BnL fleet: The Axiom!" stated the presenter in a deep, loud voice.

"Spend your five-year cruise in style..."

But the people had been gone from Earth far longer than five years.

"The Axiom!" the voice cried out with pride.

"Putting the 'star' in 'Executive Star Liner'." 

The wind was starting to blow harder now.

WALL.E narrowed his robotic eyes and turned on a set of tiny windshield wipers to clean his glass eyes.

Looking across a bay that had dried up long ago, he saw an old BnL truck that was clearly falling apart.

WALL.E's spirits rose.
