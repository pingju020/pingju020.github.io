# [](#1st Day)1st Day

in the wide, open areas of outer space,beyond the shining lights of a million stars, a dark, smoky Earth can be seen, lonely and silent.

the deepest seas are all but dried and gone.

what had once been blue sky is now brown, polluted with dust.

At times, this brown sky can still look almost golden when sunlight shines through it.

Underneath the thick, dusty air that covers the planet, mountains can still be seen rising up through the smoke.

Citis, that were once great, are now filled with old and empty buildings falling apart.

these buildings share the land with hundreds of tall towers made of rubbish.

the rubbish has perfectly shapede into cubes and arranged, one cube on top of another. these towers of rubbish can be viewed as far as the eye can see.

Only one things moves along this empty and hopeless twenty-century scene.

Day in and day out, for more than seven hundred years, he has worked to clean up the mess left by mankind.

Storms of sand and dust that often sweep along the empty streets seldom stop hin from his task.

he drives his hands, shaped like shovels, into the mountains of litter around him.

Then, he picks uo the littee and places it into the compacting unit in his chest.

Once full, he closes the doors of his compacting unit and shakes a little.

Almost immediately, he produced yet another perfect cube ready to be added to a tower of rubbish.

This is his directive.

It is what he has been programmed to do.

His name is WALL.E: Waste Allocation Load Lifter, Earth calss.

He is a robot.

He is damaged, dirty, and rusted...

And he is about to change the entire world.

"Chirrp!" A little cockroach jumped happily onto WALL.E's shoulder.

As the heavily polluted winds began to pick up speed, WALL.E and his only friend started out on a rather rough ride toward home.

WALL.E's treads were wearing thin, and the cockroach held on bravely as they crossed the rocky ground.

WALL.E drove over miles and miles of land, silent and empty life.

He saw old buildings; he passed by worn-down highways; he wheeled across the remains or broken bridges.

Everything was marked with the same company's name: BUY-N-LARGE, BnL for short. BnL had its stamp on everything!

Famous for its huge superstores, the company had once been in charge of running the entire planet.

As WALL.E hurried ahead, he ran over an old newspaper.

"TOO MUCH RUBBISH! EARTH COVERED! BNL CEO ANNOUNCES GLOABAL EMERGENCY!" read the writing on the newspaper.

WALL.E did not notice.

He pass an area full of other rusted WALL.E's units, shut down long ago.

The cockroach watched excitedly as WALL.E stopped to examinesometing of interst on one of the old units--its treads.

The treads were thick belts of rubber, built to protect the WALL.E units' metal wheels.

This old unit's treads were in much better shape than WALL.E's.

WALL.E quickly changed his old pair with the newer ones.

Then, moving on, WALL.E felt the cockroach sitting down happily on his shoulder, enjoying the new, smoother ride.

WALL.E rode past a BnL sign-board, activating its electronic picture message as he moved. The image came to life.

The lively voice of a human presenter, recorded centuries ago, began speaking through several loud speakers.

"Too much rubbish in your face? There's plenty of space out in space! BnL star liners leaving each day. We'll clean up the mess while you're away!"

WALL.E headed across an uneven highway over-pass, activating another ancient sign-board. Through the smoke and dust in the air, the image of a shining BnL star liner came into view on the screen.

Its happy passengers appeared to be enjoying all the comforts and benefits of a luxury cruise ship.

"The best of the BnL fleet: The Axiom!" stated the presenter in a deep, loud voice.

"Spend your five-year cruise in style..."

But the people had been gone from Earth far longer than five years.

"The Axiom!" the voice cried out with pride.

"Putting the 'star' in 'Executive Star Liner'." 

The wind was starting to blow harder now.

WALL.E narrowed his robotic eyes and turned on a set of tiny windshield wipers to clean his glass eyes.

Looking across a bay that had dried up long ago, he saw an old BnL truck that was clearly falling apart.

WALL.E's spirits rose.

# [](#2nd Day)2nd Day

WALL.E sped up as he headed toward his truck.

He hurried up and pulled a handle on tje truck's side.

Slowly the back door of the truck began to come down.

Once it had lowered completely, WALL.E happily drove in.

Home!

The wind shook the truck as WALL.E pulled off his new rubber treads from his wheels.

He would put them on again in the morning before returning to work.

But now it was time to relax.

He took off a worn-down BnL lunch box from his back.

It was his collection box.

He then began going through the treasures he had collected during the day.

He did this every night.

But first, WALL.E went to an old television set and turned on his favorite video: Hello, Dolly! He always played it when he arrived home.

He wathed the video for a minute and then turned back to press a button.

The button activated a shelf with movable rows of boxes where he tidily stored his treasures. The day had borne some very specail finds indeed.

He had discovered a few old toys and tools.

(all of which made WALL.E very interested, since he didn'n know what they were) and a lighter.

As he listened to the background music from the video, WALL.E became more cheerful.

He moved among his many treasures, stopping often in ftont of unclear images flashing across his television screen.

The actors were singing and dancing to the song WALL.E had been singing softly to  himself all day.

He stopped, waiting for the next part.

When it came, he hit the "Record" button on his chest and moved closer.

WALL.E could see that the actors were not dancing now.

They were walking together and looking into each other's eyes.

Then they took each other's hands.

WALL.E moved his head slightly to the side, his large eyes looking longingly at the screen. He joined together his own two robotic hands, each hand holding the other.

And for a moment the lonely robot wondered what it would be like to hold someone else's hand.

Later the night when the storm had ended, WALL.E rode outside and turned over his collection box to clean it out.

He pressed the "Play" button on his chest and listened to the song again.

Although the little robot wasn't programmed to understand love, it was love that pounded through him.

It was this same strange feeling that made WALL.E look up at the few stars noticeable through the polluted cloud of dust and wish for someone to share his world.

Suddenly, WALL.E built-in systems gave him a warning sign.

The wind was picking up again.

WALL.E checked the sky.

A massive sand-storm was approaching across the dried-up bay.

WALL.E quickly headed back into the truck.

He was  aware of how dangerous a storm  such as this could be.

The air would become filled whit so much dirt and tiny pieces of litter that he wouldn't be able to see; the powerful winds would fill every crack in his robotic body with sand; and, of course, there was always the chance of getting stuck, from head to foot, in sand.

This time he was lucky: he was close to the safety of his truck.

A bliding rush of wind and sand suddenly grew closer.

As WALL.E entered the truck and began to raise its door, he stopped for a moment, remmembering.

He then turned and made a short but loud robotic noise - like a whistle - to call for his cockroach.

The door shut just as the storm hit, with both owner and pet safe inside their little home.

WALL.E took a BnL sponge cake and set it on a shelf.

The cake was still slightly wet from the protective chemicals that had kept it from going bad for centuries.

WALL.E used it to make a warm and pleasant bed for his pet cockroach.

WALL.E turned himself into the shape of a box and backed an empty shelf.

Rocking the shelf forward and back, he closed his eyes and shut down for the noght.

Outside, the storm continued across the land.

#[](#3rd Day)3rd Day


"WARNING! WARNING! WARNING!"

WALL.E's charge-meter light flashed at a dangerously low level the next morning.

"Mmrr," WALL.E cried out in a low voice.

It was hard to wake up!

Still terribly tired from sleep, he made his way outside and climbed up to the top of his truck. Once there, he opened his solar panels and faced the sun.

He extended his tiny arms and felt a rush of power run through him.

Finally feeling awake, he heard his solar panel ring.

This meant that his electronics were fully charged for a day's work.

WALL.E happily got down from the top, entered his truck and secured his collection box to his back.

He was ready to head out to work.

As he rode out of the truck, suddenly -- CRUNCH!

WALL.E realized that he had mistakenly driven over the cockroach!

Shocked by what he had done and fearful for the cockroach's life, WALL.E immediately moved away.

"Ohhhh," WALL.E cried out in sadness.

With eyes opened wide with fear, he looked down at his pet's flattened body, searching for signs of life.

POP!
