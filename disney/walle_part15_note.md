## [](#1st Day)1st Day

in the wide, open areas of outer space,beyond the shining lights of a million stars, a dark, smoky Earth can be seen, lonely and silent.

the deepest seas are all but dried and gone.

what had once been blue sky is now brown, polluted with dust.

At times, this brown sky can still look almost golden when sunlight shines through it.

Underneath the thick, dusty air that covers the planet, mountains can still be seen rising up through the smoke.

Citis, that were once great, are now filled with old and empty buildings falling apart.

these buildings share the land with hundreds of tall towers made of rubbish.

the rubbish has perfectly shapede into cubes and arranged, one cube on top of another. these towers of rubbish can be viewed as far as the eye can see.

Only one things moves along this empty and hopeless twenty-century scene.

Day in and day out, for more than seven hundred years, he has worked to clean up the mess left by mankind.

Storms of sand and dust that often sweep along the empty streets seldom stop hin from his task.

he drives his hands, shaped like shovels, into the mountains of litter around him.

Then, he picks uo the littee and places it into the compacting unit in his chest.

Once full, he closes the doors of his compacting unit and shakes a little.

Almost immediately, he produced yet another perfect cube ready to be added to a tower of rubbish.

This is his directive.

It is what he has been programmed to do.

His name is WALL.E: Waste Allocation Load Lifter, Earth calss.

He is a robot.

He is damaged, dirty, and rusted...

And he is about to change the entire world.

"Chirrp!" A little cockroach jumped happily onto WALL.E's shoulder.

As the heavily polluted winds began to pick up speed, WALL.E and his only friend started out on a rather rough ride toward home.

WALL.E's treads were wearing thin, and the cockroach held on bravely as they crossed the rocky ground.

WALL.E drove over miles and miles of land, silent and empty life.

He saw old buildings; he passed by worn-down highways; he wheeled across the remains or broken bridges.

Everything was marked with the same company's name: BUY-N-LARGE, BnL for short. BnL had its stamp on everything!

Famous for its huge superstores, the company had once been in charge of running the entire planet.

As WALL.E hurried ahead, he ran over an old newspaper.

"TOO MUCH RUBBISH! EARTH COVERED! BNL CEO ANNOUNCES GLOABAL EMERGENCY!" read the writing on the newspaper.

WALL.E did not notice.

He pass an area full of other rusted WALL.E's units, shut down long ago.

The cockroach watched excitedly as WALL.E stopped to examinesometing of interst on one of the old units--its treads.

The treads were thick belts of rubber, built to protect the WALL.E units' metal wheels.

This old unit's treads were in much better shape than WALL.E's.

WALL.E quickly changed his old pair with the newer ones.

Then, moving on, WALL.E felt the cockroach sitting down happily on his shoulder, enjoying the new, smoother ride.

WALL.E rode past a BnL sign-board, activating its electronic picture message as he moved. The image came to life.

The lively voice of a human presenter, recorded centuries ago, began speaking through several loud speakers.

"Too much rubbish in your face? There's plenty of space out in space! BnL star liners leaving each day. We'll clean up the mess while you're away!"

WALL.E headed across an uneven highway over-pass, activating another ancient sign-board. Through the smoke and dust in the air, the image of a shining BnL star liner came into view on the screen.

Its happy passengers appeared to be enjoying all the comforts and benefits of a luxury cruise ship.

"The best of the BnL fleet: The Axiom!" stated the presenter in a deep, loud voice.

"Spend your five-year cruise in style..."

But the people had been gone from Earth far longer than five years.

"The Axiom!" the voice cried out with pride.

"Putting the 'star' in 'Executive Star Liner'." 

The wind was starting to blow harder now.

WALL.E narrowed his robotic eyes and turned on a set of tiny windshield wipers to clean his glass eyes.

Looking across a bay that had dried up long ago, he saw an old BnL truck that was clearly falling apart.

WALL.E's spirits rose.

✨1.《WALL·E 》二三事

💡《机器人总动员》是一部由安德鲁·斯坦顿（ Andrew Stanton）编导的科幻动画电影，它由皮克斯动画工作室（Pixar Animation Studios）进行制作，华特·迪士尼电影工作室（Walt Disney Pictures）电影公司负责发行。影片2008年上映后好评如潮，还获得第81届奥斯卡最佳动画长片奖以及多项提名。至于故事究竟发生了什么，跟着我们的阅读一起探索吧。

✨主要角色介绍：

💡WALL·E

💡海报中萌萌的大眼机器人就是WALL·E ，它的名字其实是Waste Allocation Load Lifter .Earth-Class（地球废品分装员）首字母的缩写。他是地球上的最后一个机器人，由Buynlarge公司制造，用于收集和压缩地球上的垃圾。

✨EVE

💡EVE的全称是地球外植物甄别器（Extra－terrestrial Vegetation Evaluator），是光滑而精巧的会飞行的探测机器人，她的任务是勘测地球上的植物，以确定是否适合人类生存。

✨当然，也不能忘了一开始陪伴WALL·E 的小蟑螂，它其实也有名字，为纪念20年代制作人哈尔·罗奇（Hal Roach）和《2001：太空漫游》中的电脑HAL，片中WALL·E的宠物蟑螂被命名为哈尔。

✨Buy n Large

💡Buy n Large（Buy and Large Corporation，Buy and Large 公司，简称 BNL ）是影片 Wall-E 世界里的一个公司，并非存在于现实世界中，但是迪士尼和皮克斯的宣传把这家公司真实化，甚至还为他制作了网站。影片中 WALL·E 就是 Buy n Large 公司的产品。Buy n Large 的装配厂设定在印度新德里。

✨Axiom“公理号”

💡Axiom是由Buy n Large（BNL）建造的众多的星际航空器之一，被描述为“BNL舰队（BnL star liner）的宝石”。它被设计成一艘在星际中航行的大型豪华游轮，除了船长之外，船上的工作几乎全部由机器人完成。Axiom有商店、餐馆、游泳池等设施，可以满足乘客的娱乐需求， 还有机器人管家，以便在发生紧急状况的时候保持秩序，让大家有序逃生。
 
### [](#1.2熟词生义)1.2熟词生义

✨1.「once」在文中是“曾经”的意思（当然我们最熟悉的还有once作为“一次”）

💡原句：What had once been blue sky is now brown, polluted with dust.

💡例句：She once was a dancer.

### [](#1.3句子解析)1.3句子解析

✨1.The deepest seas are all but dried and gone. What had once been blue sky/ is now brown, polluted with dust. At times, this brown sky can still look almost golden /when sunlight shines through it.

💡「all but」=almost, nearly，表示“几乎，差一点”。这里是说最深的海看起来几乎快要枯竭（dried and gone）了。

💡「What had once been blue sky 」What had once been blue这一部分修饰sky，曾经蓝色的天空，被尘土污染。「 polluted with dust」这里 polluted是动词的分词形式表示状态，这里表示天空被尘土污染。

💡「At times」在这里是“有时，偶尔”的意思，表示阳光偶尔透过被污染的天空。注意它和“at a time”的区别：at a time表示“每次”。

💡故事的一开始就展现WALL•E 所在的地球场景：最深的海也快要枯竭了，曾经蔚蓝的天空漫布尘埃成了棕色，有时，阳光穿透过来，棕色的天空看起来几乎是金黄色的。

✨2.Storms of sand and dust that often sweep along the empty streets seldom stop him from his task. 

💡「that often sweep along the empty streets」在这里是that引导的定语从句，修饰前面的storms，指这些这些沙子和尘土形成的风暴经常席卷（sweep along）空荡荡的街道（speed along）。

💡「stop sb from sth」组织某人做某事，这里前面加了一个seldom（很少，不常），指这些风暴也很少能阻止WALL•E完成它的工作。

💡由沙尘形成的风暴常常从空荡的街上席卷而过，即便这样也很少能阻挡（stop from）他工作。

✨3.WALL•E’s treads were wearing thin, and the cockroach held on bravely /as they crossed the rocky ground.

💡「wearing thin」wear在这里是不及物动词，表示“磨损”，“wearing thin”这里指WALL•E的履带磨损得很薄了。“as”相当于“when”，表示“当…时”,因为WALL•E的履带磨薄了，所以当穿过崎岖的路面的时候非常颠簸，小蟑螂勇敢的紧紧抓着（held on）WALL•E。

✨4.Famous for its huge superstores, the company had once been in charge of running the entire planet.

💡「 famous for」“以…而闻名”，Buy n Large公司以它的大型超级商店（huge superstores）而闻名。

💡「 in charge of」有“负责，管理”的意思。Buy n Large在人类还生活在地球上的时候，曾经负责运营（running）整个星球。来看看Buy n Large管理下的世界是怎样的~

✨5.WALL•E rode past a BnL sign-board, activating its electronic picture message as he moved. The image came to life. The lively voice of a human presenter, recorded centuries ago, began speaking through several loud speakers.

💡「activating」表示伴随着前面“通过”（past）BnL的标牌时同时“激活”（activating）电子图像信息，这些图像又鲜活（came to life）起来了。as在此相当于“when”。

💡「recorded centuries ago」是分词作后置定语，补充说明前面的人类主持人（human presenter）的声音是几个世纪以前就被录制好了，随着WALL•E的激活，开始通过几个响亮的扬声器（speakers）发出声音啦。

✨6.“Too much rubbish in your face? There’s plenty of space out /in space!BnL star liners leaving each day.We’ll clean up the mess while you’re away!”

💡「in your face」字面意思是“在你的脸上”，常常用它的引申意“咄咄逼人”。这里作为广告语既使用了字面意思又用了引申的“咄咄逼人”的意思，地球上的垃圾太多啦，都“咄咄逼人”到“你的脸上”了~这种用法大家有get到吗？

💡「There’s plenty of space out /in space!」这里的两个space意思不同哦。space out的space指的是“空间”，out在这里补充说明这个“空间”是地球之外，in space的space是“宇宙”，所以这句话表达的是“地球之外的宇宙中还有大量的空间。”

💡「BnL star liners leaving each day.」BnL star liners是Buy n Large公司的系列星际航班，这句广告语当然是说“BnL 的星际航班每天起航。”广告语要照顾节奏和韵律，所以在语法上较为随意，表达完整的意思就可以了。

💡「 clean up the mess 」clean up表示“整理，清洁”，当人离开之后，地球上只剩下垃圾遍地的混乱“mess”，Buy n Large公司的策略是将地球上的人送入太空，然后留下WALL•E这样的清洁机器人来清理（clean up）地球。

💡因为这是几个世纪之前录下的广告语，所以还在为Buy n Large公司的星际航班打广告。从WALL•E所处的环境来看，Buy n Large公司的广告成功了，人们都离开地球到外太空了。

✨7.“Putting the ‘star’ in ‘Executive Star Liner’. ”

💡「Executive Star Liner」这里指的是Buy n Large公司的高级星际航班。这句话是WALL•E 激活的电子图像中的广告语，“公理号”（Axiom）是当中最好的产品（star），借用了“star”既可以表示天上的“星星”又可以表示“杰出的人或事”的双关，因为Axiom在星际间航行，就像星星（star）一样；同时又告诉大家它是Buy n Large公司众多高级星际航班中的明星（star）产品。

✨7.Looking across a bay that had dried up long ago, he saw an old BnL truck that was clearly falling apart. 

💡「Looking across」looking这里表示伴随，表示当looking这个动作和saw an old BnL truck同时发生。

💡「that had dried up long ago」这是that引导的定语从句修饰bay，说明这个海湾（bay）很久之前就已经干涸了。当WALL•E眺望一个很久之前就干涸了的海湾的时候…

💡that was clearly falling apart和前一个that一样，也是引导的定语从句，不过这里修饰的是truck哦。这里是说他看见了一个显然已经分崩离析（was clearly falling apart）的 BnL牌的老卡车。

✨【怎样算读懂大意】

💡首先我们定义一下怎么样算“读懂大意”呢？

💡一个简单的方法就是，读完文章后，我们可以用5W1H（what, who, when, where, why, how)的方法自己转述文章讲了什么事情。如果你能基本转述出来，那就是get到了文章大意，如果感觉还比较困难，那就需要返回再读一遍去理解文章内容。

✨接下来，如果你能读懂大意，但还是觉得自己学得不够，怎么办呢？

💡其实这个疑惑跟大家所处的学习阶段有关。一般外语学习会分成4-5个阶段：
（参考国内英语教育体系，注：「词汇量」只是处于特定学习阶段的其中一个指标。）
   •    入门期(1000左右的词汇量)
   •    提高期(2000-4000左右的词汇量)
   •    增长期(3000-6000左右的词汇量)
   •    高级期(6000-15000左右的词汇量)
   
✨而每个学习阶段适用的学习方法是有所不同的。在「阅读」这件事情上，可以把学习目的区分为：语言学习(learn to read) & 获取文本信息(read to learn)。在薄荷阅读中，咱们入门课/经典课的同学通常属于2-3的阶段。所以老师建议处在入门级别/经典级别的同学们在阅读中侧重“语言学习”方面。也就意味着在阅读英文的时候，比起通过把阅读过程当成看小说，我们也要注重在阅读过程中学习英语知识、提高自己英语阅读能力。

✨02 如何在阅读中进行语言学习

💡既然是「语言学习」，仅仅读懂文章大意对处于「提高期」和「增长期」的同学们来说这种方式是不足以提高英语能力的。那针对这两个阶段的学习特点，除了读懂故事大意，还需要从以下几个方面入手学习。

✨积累单词

💡当你的词汇量还没有突破6500的时候，词汇量可能会是阻碍你读懂文章的一位大敌。词汇学家Paul Nation曾做过统计，人们只需要掌握8000-9000个英语词汇，就能满足日常听说读写需求。（这么一想，是不是觉得自己离它并不遥远呢）所以，现在咱们一定要强化【词汇积累】这个环节。

✨而积累词汇有2步，第1步是记忆【今日词表】，第2步是【在文章中唤醒你记过的单词】。

💡第2步具体说是指：

💡在我们掌握「今日词表」中的单词之后，再通过阅读文章去巩固记过的单词。因为人的大脑具有“选择性知觉”，也就是说你刚背过的单词，在文章中第2次、第3次出现的时候特别容易被你注意到、辨认出来（瞬时注意力），这样的重复过程尤其会帮助你记牢这个单词。同时你还能多接触到一个单词的前后搭配，使用语境，而不光是单词书、词汇表里光秃秃的“apple-苹果”这样的单调记忆。

✨了解一点语法

💡在「提高期」&「增长期」，很多同学容易走进的一个误区：大量地学习语法知识并把注意力全部放在上面。

💡而这个误区是应试教育对语法的要求带来的。在国内，往往初中生就已经开始大量的学习语法知识。然而，语法像是语言大厦里的水泥，是最体现语言的技能性的。

💡其实，语言本身是一门【技能】而非【知识】。【语言是一门技能】就意味着它是通过自然习得，而不是学习知识学来的。语法能力的增长是靠大量可理解的材料输入所获得的（e.g.阅读／听力），而不是靠死记硬背语法规则。

✨接着，重点来啦

💡因此我们只需要从语句学习的基础之上，慢慢的内化语言规律。在阅读的时候遇到长句不懂的时候，一定要及时向老师提问，然后根据句式结构关系来理解句意。千万不要先分析语法规则再去掌握语句。语法形式是为含义服务的，不要“死抠”语法形式而本末倒置。

💡最后回顾一下~ 目前处于是入门 or 经典级阅读的同学们，建议大家在英文阅读中更注重 【语言学习learn to read]】（等大家之后进入进阶级书单的阅读时，英文阅读过程就会变为更侧重于【获取文本信息 read to learn】

## [](#2nd Day)2nd Day

WALL.E sped up as he headed toward his truck.

He hurried up and pulled a handle on tje truck's side.

Slowly the back door of the truck began to come down.

Once it had lowered completely, WALL.E happily drove in.

Home!

The wind shook the truck as WALL.E pulled off his new rubber treads from his wheels.

He would put them on again in the morning before returning to work.

But now it was time to relax.

He took off a worn-down BnL lunch box from his back.

It was his collection box.

He then began going through the treasures he had collected during the day.

He did this every night.

But first, WALL.E went to an old television set and turned on his favorite video: Hello, Dolly! He always played it when he arrived home.

He wathed the video for a minute and then turned back to press a button.

The button activated a shelf with movable rows of boxes where he tidily stored his treasures. The day had borne some very specail finds indeed.

He had discovered a few old toys and tools.

(all of which made WALL.E very interested, since he didn'n know what they were) and a lighter.

As he listened to the background music from the video, WALL.E became more cheerful.

He moved among his many treasures, stopping often in ftont of unclear images flashing across his television screen.

The actors were singing and dancing to the song WALL.E had been singing softly to  himself all day.

He stopped, waiting for the next part.

When it came, he hit the "Record" button on his chest and moved closer.

WALL.E could see that the actors were not dancing now.

They were walking together and looking into each other's eyes.

Then they took each other's hands.

WALL.E moved his head slightly to the side, his large eyes looking longingly at the screen. He joined together his own two robotic hands, each hand holding the other.

And for a moment the lonely robot wondered what it would be like to hold someone else's hand.

Later the night when the storm had ended, WALL.E rode outside and turned over his collection box to clean it out.

He pressed the "Play" button on his chest and listened to the song again.

Although the little robot wasn't programmed to understand love, it was love that pounded through him.

It was this same strange feeling that made WALL.E look up at the few stars noticeable through the polluted cloud of dust and wish for someone to share his world.

Suddenly, WALL.E built-in systems gave him a warning sign.

The wind was picking up again.

WALL.E checked the sky.

A massive sand-storm was approaching across the dried-up bay.

WALL.E quickly headed back into the truck.

He was  aware of how dangerous a storm  such as this could be.

The air would become filled whit so much dirt and tiny pieces of litter that he wouldn't be able to see; the powerful winds would fill every crack in his robotic body with sand; and, of course, there was always the chance of getting stuck, from head to foot, in sand.

This time he was lucky: he was close to the safety of his truck.

A bliding rush of wind and sand suddenly grew closer.

As WALL.E entered the truck and began to raise its door, he stopped for a moment, remmembering.

He then turned and made a short but loud robotic noise - like a whistle - to call for his cockroach.

The door shut just as the storm hit, with both owner and pet safe inside their little home.

WALL.E took a BnL sponge cake and set it on a shelf.

The cake was still slightly wet from the protective chemicals that had kept it from going bad for centuries.

WALL.E used it to make a warm and pleasant bed for his pet cockroach.

WALL.E turned himself into the shape of a box and backed an empty shelf.

Rocking the shelf forward and back, he closed his eyes and shut down for the noght.

Outside, the storm continued across the land.

### [](#2.1背景介绍)2.1 背景介绍

✨1.Hello, Dolly!

💡《Hello, Dolly! 》（中文译名：《你好，多莉！》、《俏红娘》）是1969年在美国上映的一部歌舞片，故事发生在十九世纪末的美国纽约：精明、干练的媒婆Dolly一心一意想为富翁Vandergelder作媒，结果却促成了自己与富翁的婚姻，同时，也撮合了其他几对婚姻。

💡这种在动画电影加入由真人出演的电影胶片的做法首开皮克斯动画的先河。为了展现WALL•E是一个真的在地球上生活了几百年的机器人，而不是那种过于拟人化的实体，影片中加入了许多现实的人类社会元素，暗示了人类社会发展的漫长过程，增加了影片的真实感，其中《Hello，Dolly》就是重要的元素。而选用这部片子，则是因为这是导演最喜欢的一部作品。

✨2.BnL sponge cake

💡“sponge cake”是一种利用蛋白起泡性能，使蛋液中充入大量的空气，加入面粉烘烤而成的一类膨松点心。因为其结构类似于多孔的海绵因此被叫做海绵蛋糕。

💡BnL sponge cake 当然就是BnL牌的海绵蛋糕，还记的昨天介绍的经营全球的BNL公司吗？他们的业务从星际航班到海绵蛋糕，渗透进地球生活的方方面面啊。下图就是WALL•E给他的小蟑螂准备的BnL sponge cake了。

### [](#2.2熟词生义)2.2熟词生义

✨1.「handle」在文中是名词，是“把手”的意思。（常见的“处理，操作”的意思是它的动词意思。）

💡原句：He hurried up and pulled a handle on the truck’s side.

💡例句：I turned the handle and found the door was open.

✨2.「set」在这里是名词，有“装置”的意思，“television set”表示“电视装置”也就是我们常说的“电视机”。（我们熟悉的是“set”做动词，表示“设置”。）

💡原句：WALL•E went to an old television set and turned on his favorite video: Hello, Dolly!

💡例句：We may live without a TV set.

✨3.「bear」在文中有“具有”的意思。（我们更熟悉它的名词“熊”和动词“承受”的意思。）

💡原句：The day had borne some very special finds indeed.

💡例句：This book bears her signature.

✨4.「pound」在文中是“反复敲打”，做动词。（它常作货币单位，表示英镑。）

💡原句：…it was love that pounded through him.

💡例句：He pounded the table with his fist.

✨5.「rock」在文章中是“摇晃”的意思。（常见有“岩石”、“摇滚”的意思。）

💡原句：Rocking the shelf forward and back, he closed his eyes and shut down for the night.

💡例句：Three people were injured when an explosion rocked the factory.

### [](#2.3句子解析)2.3句子解析

✨1.Slowly the back door of the truck began to come down.

💡这句话将副词slowly提前了，强调“began to come down”这个动作是缓慢的。正确语序应该是The back door of the truck slowly bagan to come down.

💡「began to」原型是begin to ，begin to do sth表示“开始做某事”。这里采用began to是一般过去时的用法，在英文中表示过去所发生的动作采用一般过去时是很正确的选择了~

💡WALL•E的卡车是BnL公司专门设计用来运输WALL•E这样的机器人的卡车，这些卡车前面有两个大轮子，后面有履带，方便穿越各种地形。卡车内部的存货区域是各种可旋转的货架。当WALL•E清扫完一个大的区域之后，这些卡车可以将它运输到另一个区域进行清扫，当然也在晚上为处在休眠状态的WALL•E提供庇护场所。下面的大家伙就是WALL•E的卡车啦。

✨2. The button activated a shelf with movable rows of boxes /where he tidily stored his treasures. The day had borne some very special finds indeed.

💡「with movable rows of boxes」这个短句是在补充说明前面的架子（shelf）上有一排排的可移动的盒子，“with”在这里表示“有，具有”。举个栗子，想说“她是一个红发姑娘”可以这样表达：She is a girl with red hair.

💡「where he tidily stored his treasures」是一个定语从句，修饰的是前面的boxes，这些盒子里整齐的放着WALL•E的宝贝。

💡「borne」在前面的熟词生义已经解释过啦，在这里是“具有”的意思，这一天真是收获颇丰的一天啊！

💡这段话的难点在于要找到每个短句之间的关心。整句话可以理解为“这个按钮激活（activated）一个架子，这个架子上有一排排（ rows of）的可移动的盒子，这些盒子里整齐的放着WALL•E的宝贝。”

✨3. He moved among his many treasures, stopping often in front of the unclear images flashing across his television screen.

💡「stopping」这里的stopping是动词的现在分词的用法，表示动作的结果。WALL•E在他的宝贝中移动，也常常停下来

💡「flashing」和前面的stopping一样也是动词的现在分词用法，不过在这里表示状态flashing across his television screen整个部分在修饰前面的不清晰的图像（unclear images），解释说明这些图像在电视屏幕上一闪而过（flashing across）。

💡WALL•E在他的宝贝间穿梭，也常常驻足在那些电视屏幕上一闪而过的不清晰画面前。

✨4. He had discovered a few old toys and tools (all of which made WALL•E very interested, since he didn’t know what they were) and a lighter.

💡「all of which」“which”代指前面的“toys and tools”，不管是玩具还是工具，都让WALL•E 很感兴趣（made WALL•E very interested）。

💡「he didn’t know what they were」Since=“因为”，表原因。what they were充当了know后面宾语的内容，是一个宾语从句。WALL•E 对那些玩具和工具感兴趣，因为它不知道它们是什么。

💡括号部分在解释说明前面的old toys and tools。整段话可以理解为：他发现了一些玩具和工具（这些东西都让WALL•E 非常感兴趣，因为他都不知道它们是什么）还有一个打火机（lighter）。

💡收集起一堆感兴趣的小玩意，好奇宝宝WALL·E怕是和今天也在读书的你一样开心啦~

✨5. The actors were singing and dancing to the song WALL•E had been singing softly to himself all day.

💡「singing and dancing to the song」to在这里是介词，表示“伴随着 ，随着”。屏幕里放的《Hello，Dolly》是一部歌舞片，所以演员们随着歌曲唱唱跳跳

💡「WALL•E had been singing softly to himself all day」这一部分其实是一个定语从句，修饰前面的song，从句前省略了引导词“that”。还原整个句子应该是“…the song （that） WALL•E…”。这首歌是WALL•E整天自己轻声哼唱的歌。

💡WALL•E独自在地球上生活了几个世纪，他有自己的娱乐方式，他不仅喜欢看《Hello，Dolly！》，还会哼唱当中的歌曲，虽然WALL•E是一个机器人，但是也有自己的情感呢。

✨6. And for a moment the lonely robot wondered what it would be like to hold someone else’s hand.

💡「what it would be like」这个短句在wondered后面，充当“wondered”的内容，表示“将会是什么样”。what it would be like to do sth=“做什么事会是什么样”

💡WALL•E渴望地看着屏幕上四目相对，双手相牵的演员，他只能用自己的左手牵自己的右手。有那么一刻（for a moment）这个孤单的机器人宝宝也想知道牵着别人的手是什么感觉。

✨7. Although the little robot wasn’t programmed to understand love, it was love that pounded through him. It was this same strange feeling that made WALL•E look up at the few stars noticeable /through the polluted cloud of dust /and wish for someone to share his world.

💡第一个句子是由although引导从句和一个主句构成。主句部分是一个强调句。

💡「wasn’t programmed to」这里是program的被动形式的短语。“program”做动词的时候表示“用程序指令…”，wasn’t programmed to=没有被程序指令去做（没有这样的程序）…。WALL•E作为一个机器人，他并没有理解爱的程序。

💡「it was love that」这是It is…that表示强调的句型，强调是“love”敲打（pounded）了他（爱的力量不断感染他）

💡「It was this same strange feeling that」这句话也是It is…that表示强调的句型，强调的是中间的this same strange feeling，对于机器人来说，“爱”是一种奇怪的感觉

💡「noticeable /through the polluted cloud of dust」noticeable做后置定语，修饰前面的stars。through the polluted cloud of dust这一部分做状语，补充说明透过被污染的云层和尘埃仍然是显而易见的。

💡整段话都在描写WALL•E感受到的爱：尽管小机器人并没有理解爱的程序，但是他反复感受到了爱。正是这种相同的奇异感觉让他抬头仰望为数不多的星星，这些星星透过被污染的云层和尘埃仍然显而易见。

✨8. He was aware of how dangerous a storm such as this could be.

💡这个句子可以分为两部分来理解。第一部分是主句「He was aware of」，后面是“知道”（was aware of）的具体内容。

💡「how dangerous /a storm such as this could be.」这部分是一个「how+形容词/副词（dangerous）+主语（a storm）+谓语（could be）」的感叹句做宾语从句，强调的是形容词/副词部分，这里即是强调“这个风暴可能会非常危险”。还原成一般句式是“a storm could be how dangerous”。这个句式非常有用哦，举个栗子，“你永远不知道明天将会多有趣。”可以表达为“You never konw how interesting tomorrow will be.”

💡「such as this」做插入语，表示会“像这样的风暴”，“this” 指代的就是“storm”啦。「such as this」做插入语，表示会“像这样的风暴”，“this” 指代的就是“storm”啦。

 💡WALL•E突然收到了警告信号，他抬头看天，狂风四起，一大团的沙尘暴从干涸的海湾那边席卷而来，他赶快回到了卡车里，他知道像这样的风暴有多危险。
 
 ✨9. The air would become filled with so much dirt and tiny pieces of litter /that he wouldn’t be able to see; the powerful winds would fill every crack in his robotic body /with sand; and, of course, there was always the chance of getting stuck, from head to foot, in sand.

💡这段话由三个句子的组成，详细描述风暴为什么会非常“dangerous ”。

💡「with so much … that he wouldn’t be able to see」是「so … that …」句型，解释说明因为有太多细小的垃圾，而导致WALL•E也可能看不见。

💡「in his robotic body」修饰的是crack，every crack in his robotic body=他的机器身体的每一个缝隙。

💡「getting stuck, from head to foot, in sand」get stuck in sth=“陷入…当中”，from head to foot在这里是插入语，补充说明将会“从头到脚陷入沙子当中”。

💡怪不得WALL•E要躲进小卡车了，风暴来临的时候真的非常危险：空气中将会充满（filled with）肮脏的微不可见的垃圾，猛烈风会用沙子填满他的机器身体的每一个缝隙，当然，当然还有可能使WALL·E从头到脚都陷入沙子里呢~仔细想想这么大的风暴real危险啊~

✨10. The cake was still slightly wet from the protective chemicals that had kept it from going bad for centuries.

💡「was still slightly wet from」be wet from=“由于…而潮湿”，由于保护性的化学物质（protective chemicals ），BNL牌的海绵蛋糕还有一点湿润。

💡「that had kept it from going bad for centuries」这一部分是修饰前面的protective chemicals，这些保护性的化学物质使得这个蛋糕几个世纪都不会坏。

💡「kept it from going bad 」keep sb. from sth. 表示“阻止/防止某人做某事”，这里是说那些化学物质防止了BNL公司的海绵面包变质。

💡这个蛋糕因为保护性的化学物质使得它几个世纪都没有变质所以还有点湿润。（哇，几个世纪以前的古董蛋糕是什么味道呢，好奇~）

怎么利用音频最好呢，先听一遍，再看文章？or先看文章，再听一遍? or边看文章边听音频?

✨其实三种方式都是可以的，不过对于时间充足又想在听力、阅读上有大突破的同学，我们建议大家可以【边看文章边听音频】。

 💡二语习得研究表明，边听边看（LWR listening while reading）有以下好处：
 
 ✨1.帮助理解 (Comprehension)

💡 一方面，音频可以起到帮我们断句的作用。一个句子的韵律、重音、停顿有时也起到语法的作用。举个例子，张三看见/李四很高兴，张三看见李四/很高兴。英语中也大量充斥这样的句子，（比如朗读限定性定语从句&非限定性定语从句时断句也是不同的）。当音频在播放时，会帮助我们自动切分这个句子的句法成分，有时候还能帮助我们找到这个句子的重点，朗读语气暗示的感情色彩，都是帮助我们阅读理解文意的手段。

💡另一方面，音频帮助我们大脑解码，理解文章信息。对大脑而言，人们的阅读过程是通过两种通路（route）完成的——语音通路&词义通路。

💡语音通路 PR（phonological route) 是指，书面语言是口语的一种副产品，我们必须通过“发音”（读出来或脑中默念）才能明白文字意义。我们在看书时，人脑通常对生词、不常见单词会采用PR。

💡词义通路 LR（lexical route) 主张，对于成熟的阅读者，读者可以直接将字母转换成意义，就是说只用眼睛看就能读懂意思。看书时，我们大脑通常对常见词、常规词采用LR。

💡而研究发现，一些阅读障碍者正是由于不能通过PR解码来完成阅读。所以语音（如韵律、发音、拼读等等）这方面的信息，对读者理解阅读材料有关键作用。而如果我们边听音频边看文字，正是有人在帮助我们建立英文的语音信息。

✨2.提高阅读流畅性(Fluency)

💡相信你一定有过这样的经历：自己读一本（英文）书读得很慢，读完一句话，你总会忍不住回看前一句or前几行，这样下来，阅读非常耗时、效率低。而如果你边听边看，音频里的声音可以帮助你把注意力集中在文本上，push you forwards, 朗读者也会“督促”你一直不断听下去、看下去，这样阅读的效率会大大提高。视觉、听觉双输入其实可以获取更多有效信息。刚开始也许会有点不适应，但如果你坚持练习，之后阅读&听力都会变得如鱼得水啦。

✨ generally speaking，边听边读是很有好处的。但大家还是要根据自己的需求和基础来决定采用什么方法。如果你想专门强化听力，那么盲听文章、听几遍都是没问题的；如果你时间紧迫，觉得音频会拖慢你浏览文章速度，想直接阅读，也没问题。最后希望大家都能找到最适合自己的方法，提高学习效率的同时也享受阅读的乐趣哦~


##[](#3rd Day)3rd Day


"WARNING! WARNING! WARNING!"

WALL.E's charge-meter light flashed at a dangerously low level the next morning.

"Mmrr," WALL.E cried out in a low voice.

It was hard to wake up!

Still terribly tired from sleep, he made his way outside and climbed up to the top of his truck. Once there, he opened his solar panels and faced the sun.

He extended his tiny arms and felt a rush of power run through him.

Finally feeling awake, he heard his solar panel ring.

This meant that his electronics were fully charged for a day's work.

WALL.E happily got down from the top, entered his truck and secured his collection box to his back.

He was ready to head out to work.

As he rode out of the truck, suddenly -- CRUNCH!

WALL.E realized that he had mistakenly driven over the cockroach!

Shocked by what he had done and fearful for the cockroach's life, WALL.E immediately moved away.

"Ohhhh," WALL.E cried out in sadness.

With eyes opened wide with fear, he looked down at his pet's flattened body, searching for signs of life.

POP!

The cockroach sprang up, happy as ever, and none the worse for wear!

Pleased, WALL.E let his pet jump onto his shoulder for a ride and started out again.

The day began as usual.

WALL.E, like all other WALL.E units, had only one task to carry out.

He had to compact litter.

But for WALL.E, the rubbish was filled with hidden treasures.

Thinking beyond his robotic progtammming, WALL.E was always looking for new things to collect from the rubbish——things that he could add to his collections.

It was certainly a bit strange for a robot to be intersted in anything other than his pre-programmed directive.

Today a set of car keys caught WALL.E's attention.

Not knowing what they were, he went about examining them.

He pushed the "lock" button, and somewhere deep within the hill of rubbish a car's security system made a noise.

That was intersting.

Next WALL.E came across a wedding ring in a little case.

He closed the case.

It made a sudden "pop" sound.

Open.

Pop!

Close.

Pop!

the case was fun!

WALL.E threw away the ring back into the rubbish but kept the little case to take home.

He also found a toy rubber duck, a doll, and an old shoe.

He was certainly going to examine all of these further-and possibly also add them to his collection.

He came upon a short table tennis bat with a ball fixed to it by a thin, long thread.

when he chook it, the ball rapidly reflected off the bat.

This pleased WALL.E, unit——POP!

-the ball truck him right between the eyes!

"Eee!" WALL.E spoke out.

He didn't like this thing at all.

He quickly threw away the bat and turned toward something else-a fire extinguisher, though WALL.E didn't know that. 

He simply saw something that was red and kind of heavy.

WALL.E examined it until he found what he was looking for-a handle.

Usually, handles activated something.

WALL.E pulled it.

WHOOSH!

The air that immediately came out of the fire extinguisher pushed WALL.E back.

When he pressed the handle again, air came out of the extinguisher with such force that it knocked WALL.E to the ground.

WALL.E cried out in pain.

He couldn't figure out what use humans had found for this shiny red object.

Perhaps it had been some sort of game, but he didn't like it.

Time to move on.

Digging and digging, WALL.E soon saw an old white refrigrerator.

He activated a poweful beam of red laser light from a spot between his eyes.

He used this laser beam to cut the door down the middle.

The two pieces of the door fell off the refrigerator with a loud, ringing sound.

WALL.E looked inside and saw a small green object in a corner.

It was sticking out from  a small amount of dark brown earth.

WALL.E looked at it in wonder.

Now, this was something really unusual.

He didn't know why, but he liked it.

The object had a thin, long body with flat, green ovals hanging from it.

Gently, he picked it up.

Making sure that it was safe in its bed of earth, he placed it inside the old shoe he'd found later.

WALL.E sensed that the green thing was specail.

What he didn't know was that it was a plant.

### [](#3.1背景介绍)3.1 背景介绍
🎃1.Toy rubber duck

☁️toy rubber duck就是我们常见的塑料小鸭子，通常是黄色的，胖嘟嘟的样子，通常放在浴室或者浴缸里，作为小孩子洗澡的时候的玩具。可别小看这个小鸭子，它的历史可以追溯到19世纪橡胶行业的兴起时期。

☁️上世纪40年代，Sculptor Peter Ganine制作生产了5千万只小黄鸭大受欢迎，很快售罄。这只鸭子在美国著名动画片“芝麻街”也常常露面，受到了广大小朋友的喜爱，陪伴一代代的小朋友成长，也逐渐成为了西方流行文化的象征。小WALL•E也是一个不能抵挡小黄鸭魅力的宝宝啊~

🎃2.Solar panel

☁️solar panel是太阳能电池板，WALL•E在地球工作需要源源不断的能源，作为清洁地球的机器人，当然也要使用最环保的能源，所以太阳能就成为了WALL•E最理想的能量来源。

☁️事实上，从1893年法国实验物理学家E.Becquerel发现光伏效应以来，人类利用太阳能的历史已经有100多年了，太阳能资源是公认的可再生清洁能源。在电影上映的2008年太阳能资源已经得到了普遍的应用，看来导演也看好太阳能的发展前景，为WALL•E设计了太阳能面板，用太阳能提供源源不竭的能量。

### [](#3.2熟词生义)3.2熟词生义
🎃1.「wear」在文中是名词，表示“损坏”。（我们熟悉的用法是wear做动词，表示“穿”的意思。）

☁️原句：The cockroach sprang up, happy as ever, and none the worse for wear!

☁️例句：His shoes were beginning to show signs of wear.

🎃2.「compact」在这里是“压缩”的意思，做动词。（常见的是它做名词，表示“合同，契约”的意思。）

☁️原句：He had to compact litter. 

☁️例句：This powder compacts easily.

🎃3.「case」在文中是“盒子”。（我们常用的是它做“案件，事件”的意思。）

☁️原句：Next WALL•E came across  a wedding ring in a little case.

☁️例句：Please fit a new handle on my case.

🎃4.「right」在文中做副词，表示“恰好，刚刚好”，相当于“just”。（我们常用它表示“右边”和“正确的”意思。）

☁️原句：…the ball struck him right between the eyes !

☁️例句：The back of a car appeared right in front of him.

🎃5.「simply」在文中相当于“just”，表示“仅仅，只是”。（这个词常表示“简单地”。）

☁️原句：He simply saw something that was red and kind of heavy. 

☁️例句：It is simply a case of honor.

🎃6.「use」在文中是名词，有“用途”的意思。（我们常把它用作动词，表示“使用”。）

☁️原句：He couldn’t figure out what use humans had found for this shiny red object.

☁️例句：This vase is beautiful but what use is it?

### [](#3.3句子解析)3.3句子解析

🎃1.Shocked by what he had done / and fearful for the cockroach’s life /WALL•E immediately moved away.

☁️「Shocked by what he had done」和「fearful for the cockroach’s life」是两个并列的成分，主语都是WALL·E，作为修饰部分用来描写WALL·E此刻的心情，其中「be shocked by」表示“因…震惊”，「be fearful for」表示“为…担忧”，小伙伴们有体会到吗~；

☁️WALL•E充满了电，带上自己的小盒子，准备开始新的一天的工作了，却不小心从小蟑螂的身上压过去了。因为被自己所做的事情吓到了以及担心小蟑螂的生命，WALL•E 快速的移开（moved away）了。哎呀，小蟑螂究竟怎么样了呢？真担心啊~

🎃2.The cockroach sprang up, happy as ever, and none the worse for wear !

☁️「sprang up」是spring up的过去式，有“跳起来”的意思，spring本有“弹簧”之意，在这里动词化十分生动形象；这里小蟑螂本来被压在了WALL•E的轮子下，又弹起来了。

☁️「happy as ever」在这里做插入语，对内容进行补充，小蟑螂不仅又跳起来了，而且和以前一样的快乐。

☁️「none the worse for wear」这是一个固定词组，表示“毫发无损”。none与the+比较级连用，表示“一点都不，绝不”，wear前面的熟词生义介绍过了，是名词，表示“损坏”。连在一起就是“毫发无损”啦。小蟑螂生命力真是顽强啊~

☁️虽然不小心被WALL•E压在了轮子下，小蟑螂又跳起来啦，和以前一样的快乐，并且毫发无损！

🎃3.Pleased, WALL•E let his pet jump onto his shoulder for a ride and started out again. The day began as usual.

☁️「Pleased」在这里是形容词做状语，表示WALL•E做事情的状态是“高兴地 ”。放在句首强调“Pleased（高兴地）”这种心情。

☁️小蟑螂毫发无损，WALL•E 也放心啦。他高兴地让小蟑螂跳上他的肩膀，载着它再次出发。日子和往常一样（as usual）。

🎃4.Thinking beyond his robotic programming, WALL•E was always looking for new things to collect from the rubbish—things that he could add to his collections. 

☁️「Thinking beyond … programming」这里「thinking」引导表示原因的部分，修饰主语WALL•E，其中「beyond his robotic programming」表示“WALL•E的思考超越了机器人程序”。还记的之前WALL•E感受到的“爱”吗？那是因为WALL•E的想法超越了机器人程序，这里WALL•E挑选他的收藏品也是他的机器人程序没有教他的哦。

☁️「—things that he could add to his collections」破折号“—”后面常常在解释说明前面的内容哦。that后引导的是一个定语从句，用来修饰things。而这里的things既是指WALL·E最喜欢在垃圾箱中找寻的那些东西，又是“那些他可以加入他的收藏的东西”。

☁️因为WALL•E的思考超越了他的机器人的程序，他常常在垃圾里面寻找一些新藏品—一些他可以加入他收藏的东西。

🎃5.It was certainly a bit strange for a robot to be interested in anything other than his pre-programmed directive.

☁️「It was certainly a bit strange for a robot to be」这其实是一个It is +形容词+for sb. to do sth. 的句型。表示“对某人来说，做什么事怎么样”。

☁️举个例子： It is very interesting for me to read . （阅读对我来非常有趣：）

☁️「certainly a bit」修饰strange的程度，表示“的确有一点”。其中「be interested in」这是一个固定词组，表示“（某人）对什么感兴趣”。这句话表示：对于机器人来说，对一些事情感兴趣是的确有点奇怪的。

☁️「other than」表示“除…之外”，这里指WALL•E收集他的藏品是“除了预设程序指令之外的事情”。

☁️对于一个机器人来说，（WALL•E）对一些预设指令之外的东西感兴趣是有点奇怪的。

🎃6.He closed the case.
It made a sudden “pop” sound.
Open.
Pop!
Close.
Pop!
The case was fun! 

☁️「Pop」在这里是一个象声词。模拟盒子打开和关闭的声音。好奇宝宝WALL•E这次发现了一个装有戒指的盒子玩了起来。当他关上盒子的时候，这个盒子发出了“Pop”！的声音。打开，“Pop”！关上，“Pop”！这个盒子真有趣啊！

🎃7.He came upon a short table tennis bat with a ball fixed to it by a thin, long thread.

☁️「fixed to it by a thin, long thread」这一部分修饰前面的ball，描述这个球是被一条细长的线固定在乒乓球拍上的。「fixed to A by B」表示“被B固定在A上”。

☁️好奇宝宝还在挑选他的收藏品，这时候他偶然看到（came upon）一副乒乓球拍，有一个球被细长的线固定在这个球拍上。

🎃8.The air that immediately came out of the fire extinguisher pushed WALL•E back.

When he pressed the handle again, air came out of the extinguisher with such force that it knocked WALL•E to the ground. 

☁️「that immediately … extinguisher」是一个定语从句，修饰前面的“air”, 其中「came out of」表示“从…出来”，说明这个气体是“立即从这个灭火器当中出来的”。我们的好奇宝宝WALL•E玩起了灭火器，结果从这个灭火器中出来的气体将WALL•E向后推（push sb. back）。

☁️「such force that …the ground」这里是“such+名词+that+从句”的结构，表示“如此…（以至于）”。这个从灭火器中喷出来的气体带着如此的力量，以至于……

☁️「knock sb. to the ground」=“将某人撞到在地”。这里补充说明气体的力量的强大。这个力量“将WALL•E撞到在地。”好奇宝宝WALL•E在第一次被灭火器中的气体往后推之后，又一次扳下扳手，这一次灭火器中的气体力量强大将他撞到在地。

🎃9.He couldn’t figure out what use humans had found for this shiny red object. 

☁️「figure out」有“理解，明白”的意思， 「couldn’t figure out」指“不能理解”。举个例子： I couldn’t figure out this question。（我不理解这个问题可以表示为）；

☁️「what use humans had found」这一部分在句子中做 figure out的宾语，这里“use”是名词，表示“用途”，humans had found 修饰use，补充说明是“人类（在灭火器上）找到的用途”。

☁️「…what use for this shiny red object」这里的「for」表示“对于”，即“对于这个红闪闪的东西「this shiny red object」而言”。这个红闪闪的东西当然就是前面提到的灭火器啦。

☁️这个句子可以理解为：他（WALL•E）不理解人类在这个红闪闪的东西上找到了什么用途。

problems always start long before you really, really see them!

所有的问题，在你真正发现之前，就都已经出现了。

### [](#3.7 章节彩蛋)3.7 章节彩蛋

🎃相信大家在上学的时候，都有这样的经历，每逢向班上的英语学霸请教怎么样提高阅读能力时，总会收到“培养语感”这样的回复，语感听上去似乎是一个很“抽象”的东西，那么今天老师就跟大家一起来聊聊到底语感是什么呢？我们有办法提高语感吗？

🎃01 究竟什么是语感

☁️要回答“语感”这么抽象的问题，当然要先举个例子：
比如，当我们想表达“我的英语很差”时，我们的大脑常常会反应：
我的=My,
英语=English，
差的=is bad,

☁️连起来就变成了”My English is bad.” 但其实native speaker会说”My English is terribe.”瞬间觉得这样的表达更地道了有没有（好像美剧里也听到过）。

☁️我们之所以缺乏语感，是因为在表达时习惯用“中文去一一对应”，也就是先在脑中把句子的中文单词一一翻译成英文单词，再把英文单词组合输出，所以就成了“Chinglish”（中式英语）。

🎃英语语感其实是具备英文思维的一种体现，而思维包含语言+非语言（e.g.图像，符号，感觉）两个部分。语言学家索绪尔认为“语言符号本质上是语言使用者头脑中某’声音’与该声音所代表的’概念’之间的联系”。比如当提到“芒果”的时候芒果的样子就依稀从脑海里浮现出来，当提到“car”的时候一辆模糊的汽车就闪现出来了。这个现象叫做“思维闪现”MIF（Mental Image Flash）。而语感，简单点来说，就是词汇和思维图像（MIF）之间紧密的链接。

🎃这样的差异说明了为什么养成「英语语感」会如此重要，因为在听说读写中，如果不使用target-language的思维方式，那你的表达很可能会让人觉得“匪夷所思”“慢了半拍”。

🎃02 如何提高语感

☁️那要怎么加强英语语感呢？二语习得研究表明，“内隐学习”是训练语感的关键。也就是说，要加强“声音”和“概念”之间的直接链接。正如人类学母语时，也是通过大量的具象事物来促进语言思维能力发展。比如，小孩在最开始学习母语的时候，最先学会的都是代表具象事物的词汇。“桌上有一杯娃哈哈”，听到这句话，大家脑海里面会立马浮现白罐子绿包装红字体的高钙奶的样子。也就是这句话里的语言符号在脑袋里面激活了对应的概念。试想，如果一个从来没见过“娃哈哈”人，他听到这句话头脑中很有可能就一片空白啦~

🎃那么如何加强“声音”和“概念”的直接链接呢？通常来说需要足够的，有效的语言持续输入。（**如果没有足够有效的输入，就好比让一个从未接触过牛奶的小孩，去理解“桌上有一瓶娃哈哈”这句话是什么意思。）南加州大学的语言学博士克拉申提出的关于第二语言习得的五条假说(Second Language Acquisition Hypothesis)。其中有一条叫做“可理解的语言输入”（又叫做i+1原则），如果你的当前水平是i，当给你提供i+1水平的输入，你才能理解语言编码中的信息，否则语言对你来说很可能就是“噪音”了。

🎃薄荷阅读正是基于i+1来提供课程的，根据大家的现有水平，来提供i+1难度的词汇和文章。所以，坚持在薄荷阅读去加强你的“有效输入”，逐渐强化“声音”和“概念”间的直接链接，坚持阅读，让你的大脑像native speaker一样处理信息，当提到某个单词、句子时能直接闪现出相对应的概念团，也就不再需要先对它们进行“中文转码”然后再“加工输出”啦，希望假以时日，大家也能逐渐培养起“英语思维”，越读越顺利哦。
