## [](#Part 1)Part 1

in the wide, open areas of outer space,beyond the shining lights of a million stars, a dark, smoky Earth can be seen, lonely and silent.

the deepest seas are all but dried and gone.

what had once been blue sky is now brown, polluted with dust.

At times, this brown sky can still look almost golden when sunlight shines through it.

Underneath the thick, dusty air that covers the planet, mountains can still be seen rising up through the smoke.

Citis, that were once great, are now filled with old and empty buildings falling apart.

these buildings share the land with hundreds of tall towers made of rubbish.

the rubbish has perfectly shapede into cubes and arranged, one cube on top of another. these towers of rubbish can be viewed as far as the eye can see.

Only one things moves along this empty and hopeless twenty-century scene.

Day in and day out, for more than seven hundred years, he has worked to clean up the mess left by mankind.

Storms of sand and dust that often sweep along the empty streets seldom stop hin from his task.

he drives his hands, shaped like shovels, into the mountains of litter around him.

Then, he picks uo the littee and places it into the compacting unit in his chest.

Once full, he closes the doors of his compacting unit and shakes a little.

Almost immediately, he produced yet another perfect cube ready to be added to a tower of rubbish.

This is his directive.

It is what he has been programmed to do.

His name is WALL.E: Waste Allocation Load Lifter, Earth calss.

He is a robot.

He is damaged, dirty, and rusted...

And he is about to change the entire world.

"Chirrp!" A little cockroach jumped happily onto WALL.E's shoulder.

As the heavily polluted winds began to pick up speed, WALL.E and his only friend started out on a rather rough ride toward home.

WALL.E's treads were wearing thin, and the cockroach held on bravely as they crossed the rocky ground.

WALL.E drove over miles and miles of land, silent and empty life.

He saw old buildings; he passed by worn-down highways; he wheeled across the remains or broken bridges.

Everything was marked with the same company's name: BUY-N-LARGE, BnL for short. BnL had its stamp on everything!

Famous for its huge superstores, the company had once been in charge of running the entire planet.

As WALL.E hurried ahead, he ran over an old newspaper.

"TOO MUCH RUBBISH! EARTH COVERED! BNL CEO ANNOUNCES GLOABAL EMERGENCY!" read the writing on the newspaper.

WALL.E did not notice.

He pass an area full of other rusted WALL.E's units, shut down long ago.

The cockroach watched excitedly as WALL.E stopped to examinesometing of interst on one of the old units--its treads.

The treads were thick belts of rubber, built to protect the WALL.E units' metal wheels.

This old unit's treads were in much better shape than WALL.E's.

WALL.E quickly changed his old pair with the newer ones.

Then, moving on, WALL.E felt the cockroach sitting down happily on his shoulder, enjoying the new, smoother ride.

WALL.E rode past a BnL sign-board, activating its electronic picture message as he moved. The image came to life.

The lively voice of a human presenter, recorded centuries ago, began speaking through several loud speakers.

"Too much rubbish in your face? There's plenty of space out in space! BnL star liners leaving each day. We'll clean up the mess while you're away!"

WALL.E headed across an uneven highway over-pass, activating another ancient sign-board. Through the smoke and dust in the air, the image of a shining BnL star liner came into view on the screen.

Its happy passengers appeared to be enjoying all the comforts and benefits of a luxury cruise ship.

"The best of the BnL fleet: The Axiom!" stated the presenter in a deep, loud voice.

"Spend your five-year cruise in style..."

But the people had been gone from Earth far longer than five years.

"The Axiom!" the voice cried out with pride.

"Putting the 'star' in 'Executive Star Liner'." 

The wind was starting to blow harder now.

WALL.E narrowed his robotic eyes and turned on a set of tiny windshield wipers to clean his glass eyes.

Looking across a bay that had dried up long ago, he saw an old BnL truck that was clearly falling apart.

WALL.E's spirits rose.

## [](#Part 2)Part 2

WALL.E sped up as he headed toward his truck.

He hurried up and pulled a handle on tje truck's side.

Slowly the back door of the truck began to come down.

Once it had lowered completely, WALL.E happily drove in.

Home!

The wind shook the truck as WALL.E pulled off his new rubber treads from his wheels.

He would put them on again in the morning before returning to work.

But now it was time to relax.

He took off a worn-down BnL lunch box from his back.

It was his collection box.

He then began going through the treasures he had collected during the day.

He did this every night.

But first, WALL.E went to an old television set and turned on his favorite video: Hello, Dolly! He always played it when he arrived home.

He wathed the video for a minute and then turned back to press a button.

The button activated a shelf with movable rows of boxes where he tidily stored his treasures. The day had borne some very specail finds indeed.

He had discovered a few old toys and tools.

(all of which made WALL.E very interested, since he didn'n know what they were) and a lighter.

As he listened to the background music from the video, WALL.E became more cheerful.

He moved among his many treasures, stopping often in ftont of unclear images flashing across his television screen.

The actors were singing and dancing to the song WALL.E had been singing softly to  himself all day.

He stopped, waiting for the next part.

When it came, he hit the "Record" button on his chest and moved closer.

WALL.E could see that the actors were not dancing now.

They were walking together and looking into each other's eyes.

Then they took each other's hands.

WALL.E moved his head slightly to the side, his large eyes looking longingly at the screen. He joined together his own two robotic hands, each hand holding the other.

And for a moment the lonely robot wondered what it would be like to hold someone else's hand.

Later the night when the storm had ended, WALL.E rode outside and turned over his collection box to clean it out.

He pressed the "Play" button on his chest and listened to the song again.

Although the little robot wasn't programmed to understand love, it was love that pounded through him.

It was this same strange feeling that made WALL.E look up at the few stars noticeable through the polluted cloud of dust and wish for someone to share his world.

Suddenly, WALL.E built-in systems gave him a warning sign.

The wind was picking up again.

WALL.E checked the sky.

A massive sand-storm was approaching across the dried-up bay.

WALL.E quickly headed back into the truck.

He was  aware of how dangerous a storm  such as this could be.

The air would become filled whit so much dirt and tiny pieces of litter that he wouldn't be able to see; the powerful winds would fill every crack in his robotic body with sand; and, of course, there was always the chance of getting stuck, from head to foot, in sand.

This time he was lucky: he was close to the safety of his truck.

A bliding rush of wind and sand suddenly grew closer.

As WALL.E entered the truck and began to raise its door, he stopped for a moment, remmembering.

He then turned and made a short but loud robotic noise - like a whistle - to call for his cockroach.

The door shut just as the storm hit, with both owner and pet safe inside their little home.

WALL.E took a BnL sponge cake and set it on a shelf.

The cake was still slightly wet from the protective chemicals that had kept it from going bad for centuries.

WALL.E used it to make a warm and pleasant bed for his pet cockroach.

WALL.E turned himself into the shape of a box and backed an empty shelf.

Rocking the shelf forward and back, he closed his eyes and shut down for the noght.

Outside, the storm continued across the land.

##[](#Part 3)Part 3


"WARNING! WARNING! WARNING!"

WALL.E's charge-meter light flashed at a dangerously low level the next morning.

"Mmrr," WALL.E cried out in a low voice.

It was hard to wake up!

Still terribly tired from sleep, he made his way outside and climbed up to the top of his truck. Once there, he opened his solar panels and faced the sun.

He extended his tiny arms and felt a rush of power run through him.

Finally feeling awake, he heard his solar panel ring.

This meant that his electronics were fully charged for a day's work.

WALL.E happily got down from the top, entered his truck and secured his collection box to his back.

He was ready to head out to work.

As he rode out of the truck, suddenly -- CRUNCH!

WALL.E realized that he had mistakenly driven over the cockroach!

Shocked by what he had done and fearful for the cockroach's life, WALL.E immediately moved away.

"Ohhhh," WALL.E cried out in sadness.

With eyes opened wide with fear, he looked down at his pet's flattened body, searching for signs of life.

POP!

The cockroach sprang up, happy as ever, and none the worse for wear!

Pleased, WALL.E let his pet jump onto his shoulder for a ride and started out again.

The day began as usual.

WALL.E, like all other WALL.E units, had only one task to carry out.

He had to compact litter.

But for WALL.E, the rubbish was filled with hidden treasures.

Thinking beyond his robotic progtammming, WALL.E was always looking for new things to collect from the rubbish——things that he could add to his collections.

It was certainly a bit strange for a robot to be intersted in anything other than his pre-programmed directive.

Today a set of car keys caught WALL.E's attention.

Not knowing what they were, he went about examining them.

He pushed the "lock" button, and somewhere deep within the hill of rubbish a car's security system made a noise.

That was intersting.

Next WALL.E came across a wedding ring in a little case.

He closed the case.

It made a sudden "pop" sound.

Open.

Pop!

Close.

Pop!

the case was fun!

WALL.E threw away the ring back into the rubbish but kept the little case to take home.

He also found a toy rubber duck, a doll, and an old shoe.

He was certainly going to examine all of these further-and possibly also add them to his collection.

He came upon a short table tennis bat with a ball fixed to it by a thin, long thread.

when he chook it, the ball rapidly reflected off the bat.

This pleased WALL.E, unit——POP!

-the ball truck him right between the eyes!

"Eee!" WALL.E spoke out.

He didn't like this thing at all.

He quickly threw away the bat and turned toward something else-a fire extinguisher, though WALL.E didn't know that. 

He simply saw something that was red and kind of heavy.

WALL.E examined it until he found what he was looking for-a handle.

Usually, handles activated something.

WALL.E pulled it.

WHOOSH!

The air that immediately came out of the fire extinguisher pushed WALL.E back.

When he pressed the handle again, air came out of the extinguisher with such force that it knocked WALL.E to the ground.

WALL.E cried out in pain.

He couldn't figure out what use humans had found for this shiny red object.

Perhaps it had been some sort of game, but he didn't like it.

Time to move on.

Digging and digging, WALL.E soon saw an old white refrigrerator.

He activated a poweful beam of red laser light from a spot between his eyes.

He used this laser beam to cut the door down the middle.

The two pieces of the door fell off the refrigerator with a loud, ringing sound.

WALL.E looked inside and saw a small green object in a corner.

It was sticking out from  a small amount of dark brown earth.

WALL.E looked at it in wonder.

Now, this was something really unusual.

He didn't know why, but he liked it.

The object had a thin, long body with flat, green ovals hanging from it.

Gently, he picked it up.

Making sure that it was safe in its bed of earth, he placed it inside the old shoe he'd found later.

WALL.E sensed that the green thing was specail.

What he didn't know was that it was a plant.

[章节讲义](walle_part3_note)

## [](#Part 4)Part 4

WALL.E finally returned home ata the end of a long day work.

He was fillede with excitement from his new treasure--especailly the green object.

He had just reached for the handle to open his truck when a small, round spot of red light appeared at his feet.

WALL.E stopped.

He looked at the red spot, then slowly reached down to touch it.

The red spot reced away along the ground.

WALL.E hurried after it.

The red spot led him into the huge dry area by the bay.

WALL.E was so taken by the  one red spot that he didn't notice that many other red spot were coming toward him from all sides.

The little spots formed a circle around him.

WALL.E heard a deep, loud noise in the sky.

He looked up and saw what seemed like three hot suns coming in his  direction!

The noise grew louder and louder.

Filled with fear, WALL.E felt the ground shaking.

Long lines of fire dropped from above and ringed him on the three sides.

WALL.E rapidly started to dig a hole in the ground.

He jumped into it just as  a great ball of fire burnt the earth.

As suddenly as the noise had started, things quieted down.

WALL.E slowly raised his head and looked out of his hole.

He could sense something massive standing still around him.

He climbed out of the hole and hit his head on a metal object.

It was the bottom end of some sort of spaceship!

With nowhere to hide, WALL.E made the best of what was available.

He placeed a small rock on his head, boxed himself up, and hoped he wouldn't be noticed. WALL.E wasn't used to visitors, so he wasn't sure what to expect.

But he was also intersted to know what was going to happen next, even while he remained hidden.

Being very careful, WALL.E moved a bit closer to get a better look.

The spaceship set a large, metal object down on the ground.

The object began to open, its outer casing removing itself in sections.

It was as if something valuable was stored inside.

Then she came into view--a smooth, edd-shaped white robot with shining blue eyes. WALL.E looked at her with wonder as she floated effortlessly above the ground.

She was the most beautiful thing he had ever seen.

Her name was EVE.

The spaceship began to close up.

A low, continuous, sort sound filled the air.

WALL.E suddenly remmembered--he was under a ship!

The sound was coming from the ship's engines, which had just activated.

It was time to take cover again.

WALL.E dug another hole in the ground and junmped into it.

When the smoke cleared, WALL.E once again raised his head from below the ground. Shaking, he looked up and saw EVE.

She was circling over the empty and silent bay.

Looking up at the spaceship flying away, she suddenly sped up.

She flew in circles around the rubbish-covered land, unaware that she was being wathced.

She shined a wide, blue bean of light from her front panel and surveyed the land below her. WALL.E hurried out of the hole and quickly found a large rock to hide behind.

He watched EVE continue to survey objects on the ground, occasionally flying around in a circle.

She flew past WALL.E's rock.

Afraid, but alse delighted by EVE, the rusty and damaged WALL.E unit kept watching this smooth and shiny new state-of-the-art robot.

This was love.

EVE gently flew down to the ground, and WALL.E decided to move one rock closer to her. As he moved forward, he accidentally broke off a small piece of the rock.

For shuch a small peice of rock, it made quite a loud noise--RATTLE, RATTLE, KLUNK!

EVE turned around in the direction og the noise.

She immediately raised and fired the laser gun placed within her arm.

KA-BLAM!

The large rock WALL.E was hiding behind blew up into bits.

WALL.E afraid for his life, avoided heoing damaged.

EVE surveyed the area again.

All quiet, she noted, no signs of life.

She moved on, flying slowly through WALL.E's tall towers of rubbish.

WALL.E rode after her.

She had just tried to blow him up, but like a pet dog, he continued to follow her, unable to stop.

[章节讲义](walle_part4_note)

## [](#Chapter 5)Chapter 5 

He watched her study a hill of tires.

He saw his cockroach(蟑螂) try to approach EVE from behind and he
suddenly became nervous. Her powerful sensors immediately picked up(察觉) the
movement.

She turned around and fired at the cockroach.

A direct hit!

The cockroach, however, was not hurt.

He simply walked out of the smoking hole created by EVE's gun and, with his
usual desire to learn more, continued to approach EVE.

EVE let the cockroach get closer.

She was interested to know more about him, and she let him walk up her arm.

WALL.E heard EVE give out a series of electronic robot-like sounds.

She was laughing!

The cockroach must have tickled(逗乐) her.

WALL.E's spirits rose.

EVE had feelings!

Then, just as suddenly, he was struck by fear again as EVE s sensor turned in his
direction. She locked onto him with her beam(束) of blue light and fired rapidly with her laser(激光) gun.

WALL.E tried his best to avoid being hit by her shots.

He drove around among the small hills of rubbish around him, as EVE blew them
up one by one. I

With nowhere left to hide, WALL.E boxed himself up and shook uncontrollably.

EVE stopped firing.

In an electronic voice she said, ldentify(说明身份) yourself.

But WALL.E heard only robotic sounds and whistles(哨子).

He didn t understand what EVE was saying.

She slowly approached the shaking box.

The cockroach ran down EVE s arm and jumped onto his owner s body.

EVE s blue light surveyed WALLoE.

NEGATIVE(否定的).

He was not what she was looking for.

She drew back her laser gun and flew
away.

Looking out from inside his box, WALL.E watched her, completely filled with
wonder.

As EVE continued her search, WALL.E followed her to an empty BnL store.

EVE studied the store, her electronic system only repeating: NEGATIVE,
NEGATIVE, NEGATIVE.

But when she looked back at the not-so-hidden WALL.E, the lttle robot grew fearful. Turning round and round in circles, he mistakenly hit a couple of shopping carts(手推车), sending them noisily down a set of stairs(楼梯).

WALL.E, unluckily, also fell all the way down, too.

Finally, the shameful moment ended when the carts could move no farther, and neither could WALL。E.

He was stuck between the carts and a pair of doors that refused to open.

EVE paid no attention to him.

WALL.E began the slow process of freeing himself.

That evening, WALL。E climbed to the top of the BnL power plant.

He patiently waited, hoping to see EVE somewhere in the darkening sky.

Suddenly, her blue light appeared in the distance, and the circuits(电路) inside him missed a beat.

WALL.E watched her come in for a landing, ready to shut down(停止运转) for the night.

He waited for a moment and then moved toward her.

Once, he tripped by accident(意外), but luckily the noise didn' t wake her.

Sure now that she was asleep, WALL.E moved closer.

He carefully examined her with his robotic arms.

Then, turning to some rubbish close by, he began to cut the rubbish apart using the laser beam between his eyes.

The next morning, EVE awoke to find an artistic model of her made entirely of
shining pieces of rubbish.

She rose and circled the egg- shaped model. lt had bright blue glass eyes, just like hers.

WALL.E watched her from behind a tower of metal(Ï /, áJ) pipes().

He could see that she liked the model.

Pleased with his work, he wanted to come out, but he waited a little too long...and the moment was gone.

EVE flew away just as the pipes fell down--CLANK, CLANK, CLANK --onto the happy little robot s head.

His metal body was already so damaged(tF) that he hardly noticed the additional damage(t5m) caused by the falling pipes.

EVE spent her day surveying the city.

She studied a car engine --NEGATlVE.

She shut its metal door hard.

A toilet- - NEGATIVE.

A broken space ship -NEGATIVE.

And then something different happened: EVE got caught by the sea ship s large gray magnet(t#)! Stuck to the magnet upside down, she tried to turn her body over.

That did not work.

She then tried to shake her body in order to free herself.

But no matter how hard she tried, she could not free herself from the powerful
magnet.
