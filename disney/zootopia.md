## [](#Chapter 1)Chapter 1

The wild sounds of ancient predators soundeed out repeatedly through a large farm building in Bunnyburrow.

A young bunny named Judy Hopps appeared on a temporary stage.

She was trying to find her way through a fake rain forest made of recycled paper and pieces of thick cardboard.

Judy's voice rang out loud and clear.

"Fear, Betrayal. Desire for blood! Thousands of year ago, these were the forces that ruled our world.

A world where prey were scared of predators.

And predators had an uncontrollable desire to attack, injure and kill and--"

Suddenly, a jaguar sprang at her from the shadows!

"Blood,blood,blood!"Judy screamed as she collapsed under the attack.

"And death."

After a terribly long moment of silence, Judy sat up, faced the confused audience, and smiled as she continued her speech.

A poster reading "Carrot Days Talent Show" Hung over the  astonished crowd.

"Back then, the world was divided in two: deadly predator or defenseless prey."

Two cardboard boxes dropped down from the roof.

The first, labeled deadly predator in crayon, landed on top of the jaguar, and the second, labeled defenseless prey, landed on Judy.

The boxed settled on their shoulders so their heads, arms, and legs stuck out.

"But over time, we evolved and moved beyond our ancient, savage ways."

A young sheep wearing a white gown and a cardboard rainbow on his head did an unprepared dance across the stage.

Judy and the jaguar burst out of their boxes, now wearing white gowns, too.

"Now predator and prey live in harmony."

No longer actig as a deadly predator, the jaguar now looked like just another friendly youngster.

He shook hands with Judy.

Meanwhile, the sheep showered them with flowers.

"And every young mammal has countless oppirtunities,"Judy said.

"Yeah. I don't have to tremble in fear in a herd of sheep anymore," said the sheep.

Then he tore off hie gown.

Underneath his gown, he was wearing an astronaut costume that had clearly been made by hand.

"Instead, I can be an astronaut."

"I don't have to grow up to be a lonely hunter," said the jaguar, showing a business suit under his gown.

"Today I can hunt for tax relief. I'm gonna be a tax accountant!"

"And I can make the world a better place--saving lives, defending the defenseless! I am going to be..."

Judy tore off her gown and stood in a blue uniform.

"A police officer!"

In the audience, an unpleasant fox kid named Gideon Grey laughed secretly with his two friends.

"Bunny cop. that is the most stupidest thing I ever heard," he said.

Back on the stage, it seemed as if Judy had heard his remark.

"It may sound impossible... to small minds," she said, pointing at him.

"I'm looking at you, Gideon Grey."

Judy snapped her fingers and a backdrop showing a bright city with outlines of tall buildings unrolled behind her.

"But just two hundred and eleven mile away stands the great city of... ZOOTOPIA!

Where our ancestors first joined together in peace.

And declared that Anyone Can Be Anything! Thank you and good night!"

Judy proudly bowed, as it she had just given the performance of her life.

Sound of dutiful claps came from the audience, including her parents, Bonnie and Stu Hopps.

Moments later, Judy, still wearing her police costume, excitedly exited the building with her parents.

Outside, the Carrot Days Festival was in full swing as everyone enjoyed boothsm games, and rides.

"Judy, ever wonder how your mom and me got to be so terribly happy?" Stu asked.

"Nope," Judy answered.

"Well, I'll tell ya how," Stu continued, as if he hadn't heard Judy.

"We gave up on our dreams and we settled, right, Bon?"

"Oh,yes," Bonnie agreed. "That's right, Stu. We settled hard."

"See, that's the beauty of being self-satisfied, Jude.

If you don't try anything new, you'll never fail," Stu said.

"I like trying, actually," Judy said.

Bonnie looked at their daughter.

"What your father means, honey...
it's gonna be difficult--impossible, evev--for you to become a police officer."

"There's never been a bunny cop," Stu said.

"I guess I'll have to be the first one!" said Judy as she quickly jumped onto a fence for fun.

"Because I'm gonna make the world a better place."

"Or...okay, you wanna talk about making the world a better place--no better way to do it than becoming a carrot farmer," said Stu.

"Yes! Your dad and me and your two hundred seventy-five brothers and sisters--we're changing the world one carrot at a time," said Bonnie.

"Exactly! Carrot farming is a noble profession," Stu agreed.

But Judy stopped paying attention to her parents when she spotted Gideon Grey following some little kids.

Senseing danger, she was instantly alert, and she went after him.

"You get in, honey?" Bonnie asked Judy.

"I mean, it's great to have dreams."

"Yeah, just as long as you don't believe in them too much," Stu continued as he looked around for his daughter.

"Judy, Where the hell did she go?"
