## [](#Chapter 1)Chapter 1

The wild sounds of ancient predators soundeed out repeatedly through a large farm building in Bunnyburrow.

A young bunny named Judy Hopps appeared on a temporary stage.

She was trying to find her way through a fake rain forest made of recycled paper and pieces of thick cardboard.

Judy's voice rang out loud and clear.

"Fear, Betrayal. Desire for blood! Thousands of year ago, these were the forces that ruled our world.

A world where prey were scared of predators.

And predators had an uncontrollable desire to attack, injure and kill and--"

Suddenly, a jaguar sprang at her from the shadows!

"Blood,blood,blood!"Judy screamed as she collapsed under the attack.

"And death."

After a terribly long moment of silence, Judy sat up, faced the confused audience, and smiled as she continued her speech.

A poster reading "Carrot Days Talent Show" Hung over the  astonished crowd.

"Back then, the world was divided in two: deadly predator or defenseless prey."

Two cardboard boxes dropped down from the roof.

The first, labeled deadly predator in crayon, landed on top of the jaguar, and the second, labeled defenseless prey, landed on Judy.

The boxed settled on their shoulders so their heads, arms, and legs stuck out.

"But over time, we evolved and moved beyond our ancient, savage ways."

A young sheep wearing a white gown and a cardboard rainbow on his head did an unprepared dance across the stage.

Judy and the jaguar burst out of their boxes, now wearing white gowns, too.

"Now predator and prey live in harmony."

No longer actig as a deadly predator, the jaguar now looked like just another friendly youngster.

He shook hands with Judy.

Meanwhile, the sheep showered them with flowers.

"And every young mammal has countless oppirtunities,"Judy said.

"Yeah. I don't have to tremble in fear in a herd of sheep anymore," said the sheep.

Then he tore off hie gown.

Underneath his gown, he was wearing an astronaut costume that had clearly been made by hand.

"Instead, I can be an astronaut."

"I don't have to grow up to be a lonely hunter," said the jaguar, showing a business suit under his gown.

"Today I can hunt for tax relief. I'm gonna be a tax accountant!"

"And I can make the world a better place--saving lives, defending the defenseless! I am going to be..."

Judy tore off her gown and stood in a blue uniform.

"A police officer!"

In the audience, an unpleasant fox kid named Gideon Grey laughed secretly with his two friends.

"Bunny cop. that is the most stupidest thing I ever heard," he said.

Back on the stage, it seemed as if Judy had heard his remark.

"It may sound impossible... to small minds," she said, pointing at him.

"I'm looking at you, Gideon Grey."

Judy snapped her fingers and a backdrop showing a bright city with outlines of tall buildings unrolled behind her.

"But just two hundred and eleven mile away stands the great city of... ZOOTOPIA!

Where our ancestors first joined together in peace.

And declared that Anyone Can Be Anything! Thank you and good night!"

Judy proudly bowed, as it she had just given the performance of her life.

Sound of dutiful claps came from the audience, including her parents, Bonnie and Stu Hopps.

Moments later, Judy, still wearing her police costume, excitedly exited the building with her parents.

Outside, the Carrot Days Festival was in full swing as everyone enjoyed boothsm games, and rides.

"Judy, ever wonder how your mom and me got to be so terribly happy?" Stu asked.

"Nope," Judy answered.

"Well, I'll tell ya how," Stu continued, as if he hadn't heard Judy.

"We gave up on our dreams and we settled, right, Bon?"

"Oh,yes," Bonnie agreed. "That's right, Stu. We settled hard."

"See, that's the beauty of being self-satisfied, Jude.

If you don't try anything new, you'll never fail," Stu said.

"I like trying, actually," Judy said.

Bonnie looked at their daughter.

"What your father means, honey...
it's gonna be difficult--impossible, evev--for you to become a police officer."

"There's never been a bunny cop," Stu said.

"I guess I'll have to be the first one!" said Judy as she quickly jumped onto a fence for fun.

"Because I'm gonna make the world a better place."

"Or...okay, you wanna talk about making the world a better place--no better way to do it than becoming a carrot farmer," said Stu.

"Yes! Your dad and me and your two hundred seventy-five brothers and sisters--we're changing the world one carrot at a time," said Bonnie.

"Exactly! Carrot farming is a noble profession," Stu agreed.

But Judy stopped paying attention to her parents when she spotted Gideon Grey following some little kids.

Senseing danger, she was instantly alert, and she went after him.

"You get in, honey?" Bonnie asked Judy.

"I mean, it's great to have dreams."

"Yeah, just as long as you don't believe in them too much," Stu continued as he looked around for his daughter.

"Judy, Where the hell did she go?"

Judy got closer and saw Gideon Grey doing what the fox did best -- terrorizing some kids.

"Give me your tickets right now, or I'm gonna kick your defenseless little sheep behind," said Gideon, before forcefully pushing the kid.

Then he took the sheep's tickets and slapped her face with them.

"Baa-baa," he teased.

"What're yo gonna do, cry?"

"Ow!" the sheep cried out in pain.

"Cut it out, Gideon!"

"Hey!" said Judy firmly.

"You heard her. Cut it out." 

Gideon looked at Judy and laughed.

"Nice costume, loser," he said, flashing his long, sharp teeth at Judy.

"What crazy world are you living in where you think a bunny could be a cop?"

"Kindly return my friend's tickets," Judy said calmly.

Gideon laughed and jammed the tickets into his pocket.

"Come get'em. But watch out, 'cause I'm a fox.

And like you said in your dumb little stage play, us predators used to eat prey.

And that urge to kill is still in our Dunnahh."

"I'm pretty sure it's pronouced D-N-A," whispered one of Gideon's wolf companions.

"Don't tell me what I know, Travis," Gideon said, annoyed.

"You don't scare me, Gideon," said Judy.

Gideon pushed Judy so hard that she fell to the ground hard.

Judy's eyes began water.

"You scared now?" Gideon said cruelly.

The other prey animals hid behind a tree, leaving Judy to face Gideon and his friends alone.

"Look at her nose tremble," laughted Travis.

"She is scared!"

"Cry, little baby bunny. Cry, cry ---" Gideon teased her.

Bam! Before Gideon could say another word, Juddy kicked him in the face with her back legs.

The kick knocked him down for a  moment.

But he sprang right back up, and he was mad.

"Oh, you don't know when to quit, do you?" Gideon said, drawing out his claws like a fist of knives.

He slapped Judy in the face, his sharp claws digging into her skin, making her bleed.

Then he knocked her down and held her face in the dirt.

"I want you to remember this moment," Gideon said coldly, "anytime you think you'll ever be anything more than just a stupid, carrot-farming dumb bunny."

Gideon and his companions walked away, laughing, leaving Judy in the dirt.

She got up, wiped the blood off her cheek, and srarted angrily at their backs.

"Aw jeez, that looks bad," said Gareth, a sheep.

"Are you okay, Judy?" asked Sharla, the sheep Gideon had taken the tickets from.

Judy took a breath and pulled something out of her front pocket, smiling wide.

"Here you go!" she said, returning the tickets that Gideon had stolen.

"That's so cool! You got our tickets!" said Sharla.

"You're awesome, Judy!" Gareth cried out happily.

"That Gideon Grey doesn't know what he's talking about," Sharla added.

Judy slapped her police hat back on top of her head, and there was a lool of determination in her eye.

"Well, he was right about one thing: I don't know when go quit."

Fifteen years later, Judy Hopps worked her tail off in the Zootopia Police Academy.

She was small compared to the rest of the trainee police officers--who were mostly elephants, rhinos, and bison--but she was strong-willed.

Because of her size, the physical training was the toughest part.

Trainee officers had to get through problematic barriers in simulators.

These simulators imitated the weather conditions in all of the twelve unique climate environments that made up the city of Zootopia.

From freezing Tundratown to the uncomfortably hot Sahara Square, each environment presented its own set of challenges.

The chanllenges varied from trying to climb an ice wall to attempting to survive in a storm of burning hot sand.

Judy fell down more than anyone.

In her mind she could hear the voice of her parents, her drill instructor, and Gideon Grey.

All of them were telling her how they doubted that there could ever be a bunny cop.

And it was those voice that made Judy work harder than anyone else.

Through constant hard work and determination, she managed to keep up and surprise everyone.

In the final weeks of training, Judy used her bunny skills, like her strong legs and her great hearing, to help prove her worth.

She sailed through the simulations of physical barriers and at times even passed the other trainee officers.

Once, she knocked down a male rhino ten times her size during a final boxing match!
